# IntroScene
intro_txt = Many heroes of all kinds ventured into the Dungeon before you. Some of them have returned with treasures and magical \

# WndStory
story_sewers = The Dungeon lies right beneath the City, its upper levels actually constitute the City's sewer system. \
	Being nominally a part of the City, these levels are not that dangerous. No one will call it a safe place, \
	but at least you won't need to deal with evil magic here.
story_prison = Many years ago an underground prison was built here for the most dangerous criminals. At the time it seemed \
	like a very clever idea, because this place indeed was very hard to escape. But soon dark miasma started to permeate \
	from below, driving prisoners and guards insane. In the end the prison was abandoned, though some convicts \
	were left locked up here.
story_caves = The caves, which stretch down under the abandoned prison, are sparcely populated. They lie too deep to be exploited \
	by the City and they are too poor in minerals to interest the dwarves. In the past there was a trade outpost \
	somewhere here on the route between these two states, but it has perished since the decline of Dwarven Metropolis. \
	Only omnipresent gnolls and subterranean animals dwell here now.
story_metropolis = Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of dwarven city-states. In its heyday the mechanized army of dwarves \
	has successfully repelled the invasion of the old god and his demon army. But it is said, that the returning warriors \
	have brought seeds of corruption with them, and that victory was the beginning of the end for the underground kingdom.
story_halls = In the past these levels were the outskirts of Metropolis. After the costly victory in the war with the old god \
	dwarves were too weakened to clear them of remaining demons. Gradually demons have tightened their grip on this place \
	and now it's called Demon Halls.\n\n\
	Very few adventurers have ever descended this far...
